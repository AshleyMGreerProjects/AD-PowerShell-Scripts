# AD-PowerShell-Scripts

## Overview

This repository contains a series of projects focused on automating tasks within Active Directory (AD) using PowerShell scripts. These projects illustrate the practical application of Identity and Access Management (IAM) principles by automating the creation, management, and organization of user accounts, organizational units (OUs), and group memberships. Additionally, a Python script is included to generate realistic, non-sensitive user data for testing in a lab environment.

## Projects

### 1. **Active Directory User Management Automation**

**Project Description:**
The `ADUserManagementAutomation.ps1` PowerShell script automates the creation and management of user accounts within Active Directory. Key features include:

- **User Creation:** The script reads user data from a CSV file and creates user accounts in specified OUs, assigning attributes such as department, title, and office location.
- **Group Management:** Users are automatically added to specified AD groups based on their roles, ensuring appropriate access control.
- **OU Management:** The script checks for the existence of OUs and creates them if they do not exist, maintaining an organized AD structure.
- **Logging:** A log file is generated to document all actions taken by the script, providing a valuable resource for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Email Notification:** Upon completion, the script sends a summary email with the log attached to a specified email address.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Placeholders:** Sensitive information, such as email addresses and SMTP server details, are replaced with placeholders to ensure actual credentials and configurations are not exposed when the script is shared publicly.
- **CSV File:** The CSV file used in this project contains simulated user information, including names, usernames, passwords, and group memberships. While the data is not sensitive, it is structured to simulate real-world scenarios, making it valuable for testing and learning in a controlled environment.

### 2. **Active Directory User Automation**

**Project Description:**
The `CreateADUsers.ps1` PowerShell script is designed for bulk user creation and management in Active Directory. It automates tasks such as:

- **Bulk User Creation:** The script reads user data from a CSV file and creates user accounts in AD, making it ideal for onboarding multiple users simultaneously.
- **Group Assignments:** Users are automatically added to relevant security groups, ensuring they have the necessary access rights.
- **OU Verification and Creation:** The script verifies the existence of required OUs and creates them if necessary.
- **Logging and Reporting:** The script logs all actions taken and sends a report via email after execution, providing a detailed summary of the process.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Placeholders:** To protect sensitive information, placeholders are used for email addresses and SMTP configurations.
- **CSV File:** The CSV file contains detailed user data, including passwords and group memberships. Although the data is generated for testing purposes and is not sensitive, it mimics real-world scenarios, offering a realistic foundation for learning and testing in a secure environment.

### 3. **CSV Data Generation for Active Directory Automation**

**Project Description:**
The `randomly_generate_ad_users_csv.py` Python script generates realistic user data for use in Active Directory automation projects. The script outputs a CSV file with fields such as `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Username`, `Password`, `OrganizationalUnit`, `Groups`, `Department`, `Title`, and `Office`. This data is designed for testing PowerShell scripts in a lab environment.

**Script Breakdown:**
- **User Data Generation:** The script uses the Faker library to generate realistic names, usernames, and other attributes for each user.
- **Randomization:** The script generates a random number of users (between 15 and 30) with varying attributes, ensuring a diverse dataset for testing.
- **CSV Output:** The generated data is written to a CSV file, which can be directly used by the PowerShell scripts for creating and managing AD users.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Fake Data:** The data generated by this script is entirely fictional and intended for testing purposes only. This approach ensures that sensitive real-world data is not used in testing environments, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Concepts

These projects are grounded in the principles of Identity and Access Management (IAM), which are critical for maintaining security within any IT environment. Automating the creation and management of user accounts helps enforce consistent IAM policies, reduce the risk of human error, and streamline administrative tasks.

### Key IAM Concepts Addressed:
- **User Lifecycle Management:** Automating the creation, modification, and removal of user accounts helps efficiently manage the lifecycle of user identities.
- **Access Control:** Automating group assignments ensures users have appropriate access based on their roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- **Audit and Compliance:** The logging features provide a detailed record of actions, supporting audit trails and compliance with security policies.

## Security Practices

In addition to IAM concepts, these projects emphasize the importance of security in automation:

- **Placeholders:** Sensitive information, such as email addresses and SMTP server details, are replaced with placeholders in the scripts to protect against accidental exposure.
- **Data Handling:** The CSV files used in these projects contain simulated user data. Although the data is not sensitive, handling these files securely is essential to maintain the integrity of the testing environment.
