# AD-PowerShell-Scripts

## Overview

This repository contains several projects focused on automating tasks within Active Directory (AD) using PowerShell scripts. These projects demonstrate practical applications of Identity and Access Management (IAM) principles by automating the creation, management, and organization of user accounts, organizational units (OUs), and group memberships. A Python script is also included to generate realistic, non-sensitive user data for testing purposes in a lab environment.

## Projects

### 1. **Active Directory User Management Automation**

**Project Description:**
This project features a PowerShell script (`ADUserManagementAutomation.ps1`) designed to automate the process of creating and managing user accounts in Active Directory. The script reads user data from a CSV file and automates tasks such as:

- **User Creation:** Automatically creates new user accounts in specified OUs and assigns attributes like department, title, and office location.
- **Group Management:** Users are added to specific AD groups based on their roles, ensuring they have the correct access rights.
- **OU Management:** The script checks for the existence of OUs and creates them if they donâ€™t exist, maintaining an organized AD structure.
- **Logging:** A log file is generated to document all actions taken by the script, which is essential for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Email Notification:** After execution, the script sends a summary email with the log attached to a specified email address.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Placeholders:** The script uses placeholders for sensitive information, such as email addresses and SMTP server details, to ensure that actual credentials and configuration details are not exposed when sharing the script publicly.
- **CSV File:** The CSV file used in this project contains user information, such as names, usernames, passwords, and group memberships. Although the data generated for this project is not sensitive, it is structured to simulate real-world scenarios, making it valuable for testing and learning in a controlled environment.

### 2. **Active Directory User Automation**

**Project Description:**
This project includes another PowerShell script (`CreateADUsers.ps1`) that focuses on bulk user creation and management within Active Directory. The script automates tasks such as:

- **Bulk User Creation:** Users are created in AD based on data from a CSV file, which is particularly useful for onboarding multiple users at once.
- **Group Assignments:** The script automatically assigns users to relevant security groups, ensuring they have appropriate access.
- **OU Verification and Creation:** The script verifies the existence of required OUs and creates them if necessary.
- **Logging and Reporting:** The script logs all actions taken and sends a report via email after execution.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Placeholders:** Sensitive information such as email addresses and SMTP configurations are replaced with placeholders to protect against unauthorized access.
- **CSV File:** The CSV file used in this project contains detailed user data, including passwords and group memberships. Although this data is generated for testing purposes and is not sensitive, it mimics real-world scenarios, providing a realistic foundation for learning and testing in a secure manner.

### 3. **CSV Data Generation for Active Directory Automation**

**Project Description:**
This project includes a Python script (`csvfilegen.py`) that generates realistic user data for use in Active Directory automation projects. The script creates a CSV file with fields such as `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Username`, `Password`, `OrganizationalUnit`, `Groups`, `Department`, `Title`, and `Office`. This data can then be used to test the PowerShell scripts in a controlled environment, such as a home lab.

**Script Breakdown:**
- **User Data Generation:** The script uses the Faker library to generate realistic names, usernames, and other attributes for each user.
- **Randomization:** The script randomizes the number of users (between 15 and 30) and their attributes, ensuring a diverse set of data for testing.
- **CSV Output:** The generated data is written to a CSV file, which can be directly used by the PowerShell scripts for creating and managing AD users.

**Security Considerations:**
- **Fake Data:** The data generated by this script is entirely fictional and intended for testing purposes only. This helps ensure that sensitive real-world data is not used in testing environments, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Concepts

These projects are built around the principles of Identity and Access Management (IAM), which are crucial for maintaining security within any IT environment. By automating the creation and management of user accounts, these scripts help enforce consistent IAM policies, reduce the risk of human error, and streamline administrative tasks.

### Key IAM Concepts Addressed:
- **User Lifecycle Management:** Automating the creation, modification, and removal of user accounts helps manage the lifecycle of user identities efficiently.
- **Access Control:** Automating group assignments ensures that users have appropriate access based on their roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- **Audit and Compliance:** The logging features provide a detailed record of actions, supporting audit trails and compliance with security policies.

## Security Practices

In addition to IAM concepts, these projects emphasize the importance of security in automation:

- **Placeholders:** Sensitive information such as email addresses and SMTP server details are replaced with placeholders in the scripts. This practice protects against the accidental exposure of real credentials when scripts are shared or published.
- **Data Handling:** The CSV files used in these projects contain simulated user data. While the data is not sensitive, it is important to handle these files securely to maintain the integrity of the testing environment.
